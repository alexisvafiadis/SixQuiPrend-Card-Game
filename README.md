## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the card game "6 qui prend!" using JavaFX and SceneBuilder. The goal of the project is to provide an interactive, playable version of the game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to play against computer-controlled bots, showcasing skills in object-oriented programming, game logic, and UI design.

The game is developed for single-player mode with the option to play against 1 to 3 bots. The bot difficulty can be set to either "Noob" or "Pro," and after each game, the user is presented with their ranking and the option to start a new game or change settings.
