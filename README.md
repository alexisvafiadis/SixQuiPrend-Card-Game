<img src="https://www.letempledujeu.fr/IMG/arton12671.jpg?1670253592" alt="Game Image" width="200px"/>

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the card game "6 qui prend!" using **JavaFX** and SceneBuilder. The goal of the project is to provide an interactive, playable version of the game with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to play against **computer-controlled bots**.

The game is developed for single-player mode with the option to play against 1 to 3 bots. The bot difficulty can be set to either "Noob" or "Pro," and after each game, the user is presented with their ranking and the option to start a new game or change settings.
